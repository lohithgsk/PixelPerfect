> AI-Powered Image Transformation at Your Fingertips

PixelPerfect is a cutting-edge AI-powered image processing application designed to transform your visuals with precision and speed. Built using PyTorch for advanced neural networks, FastAPI for seamless backend integration, and React for a dynamic and responsive user interface, PixelPerfect delivers fast and powerful image enhancements. Whether it's generating captions or summaries or sharpening images, this application offers real-time processing with storage backed by Firebase, ensuring your images are securely stored and easily accessible. PixelPerfect empowers users to achieve high-quality results with minimal effort.


## Image Processing

PixelPerfect leverages a range of powerful AI models to provide an enhanced image processing experience. Using the Gemini API, the app creates image summaries and captions through a Hugging Face model, generating detailed and context-aware descriptions of images. For image enhancement, PixelPerfect implements the ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) model, allowing users to upscale and improve image quality with incredible sharpness and detail retention. Additionally, PixelPerfect uses Stable Diffusion for high-quality image generation, offering users the ability to create stunning visuals from text inputs or modify existing images with AI-driven creativity.
